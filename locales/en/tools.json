          "question": "What's the difference between this and the upscaler?",
          "answer": "The Photo Enhancer improves quality at the same resolution (sharpening, color, noise). The Upscaler increases dimensions. For best results on low-quality images: enhance first, then upscale."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will my enhanced photos look over-processed?",
          "answer": "No. We specifically train to avoid the artificial 'HDR look' or over-sharpened appearance. Results look like a better camera was used, not like a filter was applied."

        {
          "question": "Can you restore very old or damaged photos?",

          "question": "Does enhancement work on screenshots?",

        },
        {
          "question": "What types of photos work best?",
          "answer": "Photos with moderate issues see the best improvement. Slightly blurry, noisy, or faded photos enhance well. Severely damaged photos will improve but have limits."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I enhance and upscale together?",
