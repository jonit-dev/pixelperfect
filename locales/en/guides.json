        "Start Using AVIF Now: Even with ~75% browser support, the 70% file size reduction makes AVIF worth implementing today with proper fallbacks.",

        "Batch Convert During Off-Hours: AVIF encoding can be slow. Schedule batch conversion jobs for nights or weekends when server load is lower.",
        "Test Quality Before Deploying: AVIF's compression is so efficient that it's easy to over-compress. Always test quality on sample images before full deployment.",
        "Monitor Browser Support Stats: Track AVIF support in your analytics. When it reaches 90%+, you can consider simplifying your fallback strategy.",
        "Keep Original Source Files: AVIF is lossy compression. Always keep your original PNG/RAW files as masters for future re-encoding with better tools.",
        "Use CDNs with AVIF Support: Many CDNs automatically convert and serve AVIF. Leverage this rather than generating AVIF files yourself."
