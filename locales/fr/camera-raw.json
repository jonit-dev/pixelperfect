        {
          "question": "Should I use 12-bit or 14-bit NEF for upscaling?",
          "answer": "Always use 14-bit NEF files when possible for upscaling. 14-bit files contain 16,384 tonal levels per channel compared to 4,096 in 12-bit files, providing significantly more data for IA algorithms to work with. The additional data results in smoother gradients, better shadow detail recovery, and superior color accuracy after upscaling."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does upscaling affect Nikon's Picture Control settings?",
          "answer": "Our IA technology preserves and enhances the characteristics of your chosen Picture Control setting. Whether you shot with Flat for maximum editing flexibility or Vivid for punchy colors, the upscaling process maintains the intended look while adding detail and Résolution."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can IA upscaling recover detail from motion-blurred NEF files?",
          "answer": "IA upscaling works Meilleur on properly focused Images. While it can enhance some sharpness, it cannot fully correct significant motion blur. For optimal results, ensure proper focus technique and adequate shutter speed during capture. Minor sharpening improvements are possible, but major blur correction requires specialized deconvolution Outils."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the Meilleur workflow for upscaling NEF files from Nikon Z-series cameras?",
          "answer": "For Z-series NEF files, shoot in 14-bit uncompressed RAW, use Picture Control Flat for maximum flexibility, perform initial corrections in Nikon NX Studio or Lightroom, apply noise reduction if needed, then upscale before final creative adjustments. The BSI sensor data in Z-series files provides exceptional upscaling potential."
        },
        {
          "question": "How large can I Impression upscaled NEF files?",
          "answer": "With proper upscaling, NEF files can produce excellent Qualité prints up to 60 inches on the long dimension (from full-frame cameras) and even larger from high-Résolution models like the Z9. The exact Impression size depends on viewing distance, subject matter, and printing method. For gallery-Qualité prints viewed from normal distances, significant enlargement is possible."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will upscaling affect my ability to use Nikon's lens corrections?",
          "answer": "No, upscaling preserves all lens metadata needed for Nikon's lens corrections. In fact, applying lens corrections before upscaling often provides better results as the IA algorithms can work with corrected, optically perfect data. Distortion, vignetting, and chromatic aberration corrections remain fully effective after upscaling."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I Lot process NEF files from different Nikon cameras?",
          "answer": "Yes, our Agrandisseur can handle NEF files from any Nikon camera model in a single Lot. The IA automatically adapts to the specific sensor characteristics of each camera while maintaining consistent output Qualité. This is particularly useful for wedding photographers or anyone working with Plusieurs camera bodies."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does upscaling interact with Nikon's Active D-Lighting?",
          "answer": "Active D-Lighting data is preserved and respected during upscaling. The IA Amélioration works with the extended dynamic range information to maintain highlight and shadow detail. For Meilleur results, shoot with Active D-Lighting enabled if the scene has high contrast, as this provides more data for the upscaling algorithms to work with."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the file size increase after upscaling NEF files?",
          "answer": "Upscaling typically increases file size by 4-8 times depending on the output resolution and format. A 45MP NEF file upscaling to 180MP will be approximately 4 times larger in uncompressed formats. Using efficient output formats like DNG or high-quality JPEG can help manage file sizes while maintaining image quality."
