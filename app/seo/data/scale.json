          "answer": "4K resolution (also called Ultra HD or UHD) is 3840 x 2160 pixels—exactly 4 times the resolution of Full HD (1920x1080). The name '4K' comes from the approximately 4000 pixels of horizontal resolution."

          "question": "Can I upscale any image to 4K?",
          "answer": "Yes! Our AI can upscale images from any starting resolution to 4K. However, starting with higher quality source images will yield better results. Images below 720p may show some artifacts when scaled to 4K."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will my 4K image look good on all screens?",
          "answer": "Yes. 4K images will look excellent on 4K displays and will be automatically downscaled (looking great) on lower resolution screens. It's better to have higher resolution and scale down than the opposite."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does it take to upscale to 4K?",
          "answer": "Typically 45-90 seconds depending on the source image size. Larger source images take slightly longer to process to 4K resolution."

          "question": "Should I upscale to HD or 4K?",

          "question": "Can I print HD resolution images?",
          "answer": "Yes! 1080p provides enough resolution for prints up to approximately 16x9 inches at high quality (300 DPI). For larger prints, consider upscaling to 4K instead."
