        "Prepare Images Before Upsizing: Do color correction, cropping, and basic edits BEFORE upsizing. It's easier to edit smaller files, and upsizing will enhance your edits too.",
        "Consider Print Bleed and Margins: When upsizing for print, add extra pixels beyond your target size to account for bleed (typically 0.125-0.25 inches = 38-75 pixels at 300 DPI).",
        "Use the Right Tool for the Job: Different AI models excel at different tasks. Use specialized models for portraits, architecture, or artistic images when available.",
        "Maintain Aspect Ratio: Always lock aspect ratio when upsizing unless specifically cropping to a different ratio. Distorted images look unprofessional.",
        "Check at Multiple Zoom Levels: Inspect upsized images at 100%, 200%, and fit-to-screen to catch different types of artifacts.",
        "Consider the Viewing Distance: Images viewed from further away (large prints, billboards) don't need as much detail as those viewed up close.",

        "Create Custom Presets: Save successful settings as presets for similar future projects to ensure consistency and save time.",
