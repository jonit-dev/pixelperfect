          "question": "Can you really enlarge images 8x without quality loss?",
          "answer": "Yes! Our AI doesn't just stretch pixels - it intelligently reconstructs the image at higher resolution. While it can't add information that was never captured, it can generate realistic details that make the enlarged image look natural and sharp, not blurry or pixelated."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the largest size I can enlarge to?",
          "answer": "You can enlarge up to 8x the original dimensions. For example, a 500x500px image can become 4000x4000px. If you need larger, you can download the 8x version and enlarge it again for even higher resolution."

          "question": "Will enlarged images work for professional printing?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. AI-enlarged images meet professional print standards. Many of our users enlarge images to achieve 300 DPI at poster sizes and beyond, with excellent print results."
