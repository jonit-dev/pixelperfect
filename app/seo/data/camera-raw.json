        {
          "question": "What makes NEF format unique compared to other RAW formats?",
          "answer": "NEF files contain Nikon's proprietary Picture Control settings, Active D-Lighting data, and comprehensive lens metadata that contribute to Nikon's distinctive image character. The format also includes detailed autofocus tracking data and Vibration Reduction information that helps optimize image quality."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I use 12-bit or 14-bit NEF for upscaling?",
          "answer": "Always use 14-bit NEF files when possible for upscaling. 14-bit files contain 16,384 tonal levels per channel compared to 4,096 in 12-bit files, providing significantly more data for AI algorithms to work with. The additional data results in smoother gradients, better shadow detail recovery, and superior color accuracy after upscaling."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does upscaling affect Nikon's Picture Control settings?",
          "answer": "Our AI technology preserves and enhances the characteristics of your chosen Picture Control setting. Whether you shot with Flat for maximum editing flexibility or Vivid for punchy colors, the upscaling process maintains the intended look while adding detail and resolution."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can AI upscaling recover detail from motion-blurred NEF files?",
          "answer": "AI upscaling works best on properly focused images. While it can enhance some sharpness, it cannot fully correct significant motion blur. For optimal results, ensure proper focus technique and adequate shutter speed during capture. Minor sharpening improvements are possible, but major blur correction requires specialized deconvolution tools."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best workflow for upscaling NEF files from Nikon Z-series cameras?",
          "answer": "For Z-series NEF files, shoot in 14-bit uncompressed RAW, use Picture Control Flat for maximum flexibility, perform initial corrections in Nikon NX Studio or Lightroom, apply noise reduction if needed, then upscale before final creative adjustments. The BSI sensor data in Z-series files provides exceptional upscaling potential."
        },
        {
          "question": "How large can I print upscaled NEF files?",
          "answer": "With proper upscaling, NEF files can produce excellent quality prints up to 60 inches on the long dimension (from full-frame cameras) and even larger from high-resolution models like the Z9. The exact print size depends on viewing distance, subject matter, and printing method. For gallery-quality prints viewed from normal distances, significant enlargement is possible."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will upscaling affect my ability to use Nikon's lens corrections?",
          "answer": "No, upscaling preserves all lens metadata needed for Nikon's lens corrections. In fact, applying lens corrections before upscaling often provides better results as the AI algorithms can work with corrected, optically perfect data. Distortion, vignetting, and chromatic aberration corrections remain fully effective after upscaling."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I batch process NEF files from different Nikon cameras?",
          "answer": "Yes, our upscaler can handle NEF files from any Nikon camera model in a single batch. The AI automatically adapts to the specific sensor characteristics of each camera while maintaining consistent output quality. This is particularly useful for wedding photographers or anyone working with multiple camera bodies."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does upscaling interact with Nikon's Active D-Lighting?",
          "answer": "Active D-Lighting data is preserved and respected during upscaling. The AI enhancement works with the extended dynamic range information to maintain highlight and shadow detail. For best results, shoot with Active D-Lighting enabled if the scene has high contrast, as this provides more data for the upscaling algorithms to work with."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the file size increase after upscaling NEF files?",
          "answer": "Upscaling typically increases file size by 4-8 times depending on the output resolution and format. A 45MP NEF file upscaling to 180MP will be approximately 4 times larger in uncompressed formats. Using efficient output formats like DNG or high-quality JPEG can help manage file sizes while maintaining image quality."

          "question": "What makes Canon CR2 format special compared to other RAW formats?",
          "answer": "CR2 files contain Canon's proprietary Picture Style data, Dual Pixel AF information, comprehensive lens correction metadata, and Canon's renowned color science algorithms. This unique combination provides exceptional skin tone rendition and professional workflow capabilities that distinguish Canon files from other manufacturers."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I enable Dual Pixel RAW for upscaling?",
          "answer": "Yes, enabling Dual Pixel RAW when available provides significant advantages for upscaling. The additional depth information and enhanced editing options allow for better bokeh adjustments and focus fine-tuning before upscaling, resulting in superior final image quality. However, it does increase file size slightly."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does upscaling affect Canon's Picture Style settings?",
          "answer": "Our AI technology preserves and enhances the characteristics of your selected Picture Style. Whether using Portrait for warm skin tones or Landscape for vibrant colors, the upscaling process maintains Canon's signature look while adding detail and resolution. Custom Picture Styles are also preserved and enhanced."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best workflow for wedding photographers using CR2 files?",
          "answer": "Wedding photographers benefit from a streamlined workflow: shoot in RAW+JPEG for quick client delivery, perform initial culling in JPEG, then select best images for RAW editing. Use Canon DPP for initial processing with Picture Style adjustments, apply lens corrections, then upscale before final color grading. Batch process similar scenes for consistency."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can AI upscaling correct focus issues in CR2 files?",
          "answer": "While AI upscaling can enhance perceived sharpness, it cannot fundamentally correct out-of-focus images. However, with Dual Pixel RAW files, you can make subtle focus adjustments before upscaling. For optimal results, ensure accurate focus during capture using Canon's advanced AF systems."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does upscaling work with Canon's Digital Lens Optimizer?",
          "answer": "The Digital Lens Optimizer (DLO) should be applied before upscaling for best results. DLO corrects optical imperfections, providing clean data for AI enhancement. The combination yields exceptional sharpness and detail. Apply DLO in Canon DPP, then upscale before final creative adjustments."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the maximum print size from upscaled CR2 files?",
          "answer": "Upscaled CR2 files from modern Canon full-frame cameras can produce excellent quality prints up to 72 inches on the long dimension. High-resolution models like the 5DS R can print even larger. The actual size depends on viewing distance, subject matter, and print quality. For gallery exhibitions viewed up close, 40-60 inches is realistic."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I batch process CR2 files from different Canon camera models?",
          "answer": "Yes, our upscaler handles CR2 files from any Canon camera model seamlessly. The AI automatically adapts to each camera's sensor characteristics while maintaining consistent output quality. This is particularly valuable for professional photographers using multiple camera bodies or upgrading equipment."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does upscaling affect Canon's renowned skin tones?",
          "answer": "Our AI technology specifically preserves Canon's exceptional skin tone reproduction while enhancing detail. The algorithms recognize and protect the subtle color transitions that make Canon portraits special, adding resolution without compromising the natural, pleasing skin tones that photographers value."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I use lossless compression or uncompressed CR2 for upscaling?",
          "answer": "Lossless compressed CR2 files provide excellent results for upscaling while saving storage space. The difference between lossless compressed and uncompressed is minimal for most practical purposes. However, if maximum quality is required and storage is not a concern, uncompressed files offer slight advantages in extreme post-processing scenarios."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does file size change after upscaling CR2 images?",
          "answer": "Upscaling typically increases file size by 4-6 times depending on output resolution. A 30MP CR2 file upscaling to 120MP will be approximately 4 times larger. Consider storage requirements and workflow efficiency when deciding on output resolution. Using efficient output formats can help manage file sizes."
