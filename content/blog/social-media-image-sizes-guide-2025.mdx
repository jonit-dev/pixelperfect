You've crafted the perfect post, but your image looks pixelated on Instagram and cropped weirdly on LinkedIn. Every social media platform has different image requirements, and they change constantly. Getting it wrong means lost engagement and an unprofessional look.

This guide covers every image dimension you need for major social platforms in 2025—plus how to ensure your images meet these requirements even when your source photos are too small.

## Quick Reference: All Platform Sizes

### Instagram

| Placement | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Square Post | 1080×1080 | 1:1 |
| Portrait Post | 1080×1350 | 4:5 |
| Landscape Post | 1080×566 | 1.91:1 |
| Story/Reel | 1080×1920 | 9:16 |
| Profile Photo | 320×320 | 1:1 |
| Carousel | 1080×1080 | 1:1 |

<Callout type="tip">
Instagram's algorithm favors portrait (4:5) posts because they take up more screen space in the feed. Use 1080×1350 for maximum visibility.

## The Problem: Your Images Are Too Small

You have a great product photo at 600×400 pixels. You need it for:
- Instagram post (1080×1080)
- Facebook ad (1200×630)
- Pinterest pin (1000×1500)

Traditional resizing would stretch and blur your image. Here's where AI upscaling becomes essential.

## How to Resize Images for Any Platform

### Step 1: Upscale to Maximum Needed Size

Calculate the largest dimension you'll need across all platforms:

```
Instagram portrait: 1350px tall
Pinterest long pin: 2100px tall
Facebook cover: 1200px wide

→ Upscale source to at least 2100px on longest side
```

### Step 2: AI Upscale Your Source

Using [myimageupscaler.com](/pricing):

1. Upload your original image
2. Select 2x or 4x upscale (whichever gets you above your max needed size)
3. Download the enhanced version

<Callout type="info">
Always upscale once to your maximum needed size, then crop down for smaller formats. Never upscale the same image multiple times—quality degrades with each pass.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Create Platform-Specific Versions

From your upscaled master, crop to each platform's requirements:

**For Instagram (1080×1350):**
- Crop to 4:5 aspect ratio
- Export at 1080×1350

**For Facebook (1200×630):**
- Crop to 1.91:1 aspect ratio
- Export at 1200×630

**For Pinterest (1000×1500):**
- Crop to 2:3 aspect ratio
- Export at 1000×1500

## Platform-Specific Tips

### Instagram Best Practices

- **Use portrait orientation** (4:5) for feed posts—more screen real estate
- **Carousel posts** get higher engagement—all images should be consistent size
- **Stories**: Full-screen 9:16, keep text away from top/bottom 250px (UI overlays)
- **Minimum resolution**: 1080px wide (Instagram compresses smaller images aggressively)

### Facebook Best Practices

- **Link previews** auto-crop to 1.91:1—design for this ratio
- **Cover photos** display differently on mobile vs desktop—keep key content centered
- **Avoid text over 20%** of image area for ads (algorithm penalty)

### LinkedIn Best Practices

- **Professional aesthetic**—avoid overly casual or meme-style images
- **Article covers** should be high-contrast and readable at small sizes
- **Company page banners** get cropped on mobile—test both views

### Pinterest Best Practices

- **Vertical pins** (2:3 ratio) perform best—they dominate the feed
- **Text overlays** are common and effective on Pinterest
- **Rich, saturated colors** tend to get more saves
- **Minimum 600px wide** to avoid quality loss

### Twitter/X Best Practices

- **16:9 ratio** displays without cropping in timeline
- **Cards** (1.91:1) for link previews and ads
- **GIFs and video** often outperform static images

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Uploading Too-Small Images

Each platform has minimum requirements. Upload smaller images and they'll be:
- Stretched (blurry)
- Rejected (ads)
- Compressed aggressively (grainy)

**Solution**: Always upscale to meet or exceed minimum dimensions.

### 2. Ignoring Aspect Ratios

Uploading a square image to a 16:9 placement means:
- Auto-cropping (losing content)
- Letterboxing (wasted space)
- Unprofessional appearance

**Solution**: Create platform-specific crops from your master image.

### 3. Over-Compressing

Saving as low-quality JPEG to reduce file size makes images look terrible on high-DPI screens.

**Solution**: Export at quality 80-90%. Platforms will compress further—don't do it twice.

### 4. Forgetting Mobile

Most social media consumption happens on phones. Images that look good on desktop may:
- Have unreadable text on mobile
- Lose important details when scaled down
- Crop unexpectedly on smaller screens

**Solution**: Preview on mobile before posting. Design for the smallest screen.

## Batch Processing for Multiple Platforms

Managing images for multiple platforms is time-consuming. Here's an efficient workflow:

### 1. Start with High-Resolution Source

- Photograph at highest quality settings
- Use RAW format when possible
- If sourcing externally, request largest available

### 2. Create a Master Upscaled Version

- Upscale to largest needed dimension
- Save in lossless format (PNG or TIFF)
- This is your source for all derivatives

### 3. Use Templates or Presets

Create saved crop presets for each platform:
- Instagram Square: 1080×1080
- Instagram Portrait: 1080×1350
- Facebook Post: 1200×630
- Pinterest: 1000×1500
- etc.

### 4. Export in Batches

For each piece of content:
1. Open master image
2. Apply each crop preset
3. Export with platform-appropriate filename
4. Upload to scheduling tool

## File Format Recommendations

| Platform | Recommended Format | Max File Size |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Instagram | JPEG (posts), PNG (graphics) | 30MB |
| Facebook | JPEG, PNG | 30MB |
| Twitter | JPEG, PNG, GIF | 5MB (images) |
| LinkedIn | JPEG, PNG | 8MB |
| Pinterest | JPEG, PNG | 20MB |

<Callout type="warning">
Avoid uploading PNG photos to Instagram—they get compressed more aggressively than JPEG. Use PNG only for graphics with text or transparency.

## Future-Proofing Your Images

Social platforms regularly increase resolution requirements as screens improve. Protect yourself:

1. **Archive originals** at highest quality
2. **Upscale before cropping** to maximum foreseeable need
3. **Re-export periodically** when platforms update requirements
4. **Monitor announcements** for dimension changes

## Quick Action Checklist

- [ ] Key content isn't cropped on mobile view
- [ ] Text (if any) is readable at small sizes
