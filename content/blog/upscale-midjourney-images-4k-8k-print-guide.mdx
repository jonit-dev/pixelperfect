You've created stunning AI art with Midjourney, but when you try to print it or use it on a 4K display, it looks pixelated. Midjourney's native resolution is impressive for web use, but falls short for large prints, wallpapers, and professional applications. The solution? AI upscaling that preserves your artwork's quality while dramatically increasing resolution.

This guide covers everything you need to know about upscaling Midjourney images—from understanding native resolutions to creating print-ready masterpieces.

## Understanding Midjourney's Native Resolution

*Creating stunning AI art is just the first step—upscaling unlocks its full potential.*

Before upscaling, you need to understand what Midjourney actually outputs:

### Default Resolutions by Version

| Midjourney Version | Default Resolution | Max with Upscale | Megapixels |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| V6 | 1024×1024 | ~2048×2048 | 1-4 MP |
| V5.2 | 1024×1024 | ~1536×1536 | 1-2.3 MP |
| V5.1 | 1024×1024 | ~1456×1456 | 1-2.1 MP |
| V5 | 1024×1024 | ~1536×1536 | 1-2.3 MP |
| Niji 6 | 1024×1024 | ~2048×2048 | 1-4 MP |

### Aspect Ratio Considerations

Midjourney's `--ar` parameter changes dimensions while maintaining overall pixel count:

```
--ar 1:1  → 1024×1024 (1 MP)
--ar 16:9 → 1456×816 (1.2 MP)
--ar 2:3  → 832×1248 (1 MP)
--ar 3:2  → 1248×832 (1 MP)
```

<Callout type="info">
Regardless of aspect ratio, Midjourney maintains approximately 1 megapixel at default resolution. Even with built-in upscaling, you're capped at around 4 megapixels—not enough for large prints.

## What Resolution Do You Actually Need?

Let's calculate requirements for common use cases:

### Digital Display Requirements

| Use Case | Minimum Resolution | Recommended |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1080p wallpaper | 1920×1080 | 2560×1440 |
| 4K wallpaper | 3840×2160 | 4096×2304 |
| 8K wallpaper | 7680×4320 | 8192×4608 |
| Instagram post | 1080×1080 | 1440×1440 |
| YouTube thumbnail | 1280×720 | 1920×1080 |

### Print Requirements at 300 DPI

| Print Size | Pixels Needed | Midjourney Native | Gap |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| 5×7 inches | 1500×2100 | 1024×1024 | 2x needed |
| 8×10 inches | 2400×3000 | 1024×1024 | 3x needed |
| 11×14 inches | 3300×4200 | 1024×1024 | 4x needed |
| 16×20 inches | 4800×6000 | 1024×1024 | 5-6x needed |
| 24×36 inches | 7200×10800 | 1024×1024 | 7-10x needed |

<Callout type="warning">
For quality prints, you need 300 DPI. A standard Midjourney image can only print at ~3.4 inches at full quality without upscaling.
</Callout>

## Method 1: Midjourney's Built-In Upscale

Midjourney offers native upscaling options, but they have limitations.

### Using the U1-U4 Buttons

After generating an image grid:
1. Click **U1**, **U2**, **U3**, or **U4** to select and upscale
2. The image upscales to approximately 1024×1024 (if starting from grid)
3. Use **Upscale (Subtle)** or **Upscale (Creative)** for further enhancement

### Upscale Subtle vs. Creative

| Option | What It Does | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Upscale (Subtle) | Doubles resolution with minimal changes | Preserving original details |
| Upscale (Creative) | Adds new details while upscaling | More stylized enhancement |

### Limitations of Native Upscaling

- Maximum ~4 megapixels (2048×2048)
- Uses additional fast/relax hours
- Limited control over enhancement style
- Not sufficient for large prints
- Quality can vary unpredictably

## Method 2: External AI Upscaling (Recommended)

For serious print work or 4K+ displays, external AI upscaling is essential.

### Why External Upscalers Work Better

1. **Specialized Training**: Trained specifically on upscaling tasks
2. **Higher Limits**: Achieve 4x, 8x, or even 16x scaling
3. **Consistent Results**: Predictable, reliable quality
4. **No Credit Usage**: Doesn't consume Midjourney hours
5. **More Control**: Choose enhancement intensity

### Step-by-Step: Upscaling Midjourney Images

Here's the complete workflow using [myimageupscaler.com](/pricing):

**Step 1: Generate Your Base Image**

```
/imagine a majestic mountain landscape at sunset,
cinematic lighting, highly detailed --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

Use the highest quality settings in Midjourney:
- Use `--quality 2` for more detail (uses more GPU time)
- Add `--style raw` for less processing (more upscaling headroom)

**Step 2: Use Midjourney's Native Upscale First**

Click the **U** button for your preferred variation, then use **Upscale (Subtle)**. This gives you the best starting point.

**Step 3: Download the Full Resolution**

Click on the upscaled image, then open in browser and save. Ensure you're getting the full resolution, not a preview.

**Step 4: AI Upscale**

1. Visit [myimageupscaler.com](/pricing)
2. Upload your Midjourney image
3. Select **2x** for moderate upscaling or **4x** for maximum resolution
4. Process (typically 30-60 seconds)
5. Download your enhanced image

<Callout type="tip">
For a ~2048×2048 Midjourney image, a 4x upscale produces ~8192×8192 pixels—perfect for 8K displays or 27-inch prints at 300 DPI.

## Print-Ready Workflow: Complete Guide

![Professional photo printing setup](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1612815154858-60aa4c59eaa6?w=800&q=80)
*Proper preparation ensures your AI art looks stunning in print.*

Creating print-worthy files from Midjourney requires attention to several factors.

### Workflow Overview

```
Midjourney Generate → Native Upscale → Download PNG
→ AI Upscale → Color Profile → Export for Print
```

### Step 1: Optimize Midjourney Generation

For print-intended artwork:

```
/imagine [your prompt] --ar [print ratio] --v 6 --quality 2
```

Use these aspect ratios for common print sizes:

| Print Size | Aspect Ratio | Midjourney Setting |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 4×6 | 2:3 | `--ar 2:3` |
| 5×7 | 5:7 | `--ar 5:7` |
| 8×10 | 4:5 | `--ar 4:5` |
| 11×14 | 11:14 | `--ar 11:14` |
| 16×20 | 4:5 | `--ar 4:5` |

### Step 2: Calculate Upscaling Requirements

Use this formula:

```
Required Scale = (Print Inches × 300 DPI) ÷ Current Pixels

Example: 16×20 print from 2048×2560 image
Width: (16 × 300) ÷ 2048 = 2.34x
Height: (20 × 300) ÷ 2560 = 2.34x

→ Use 4x upscale for safety margin
```

### Step 3: AI Upscaling for Print

Upload to myimageupscaler.com and select the appropriate scale:

| Starting Resolution | 2x Result | 4x Result | Recommended For |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1024×1024 | 2048×2048 | 4096×4096 | Up to 11×11" |
| 2048×2048 | 4096×4096 | 8192×8192 | Up to 24×24" |
| 1456×816 (16:9) | 2912×1632 | 5824×3264 | Wide format up to 19×11" |

### Step 4: Color Space Conversion

For professional printing:

1. **Open in Photoshop/GIMP**
2. **Convert to CMYK**: Edit → Convert to Profile → CMYK
3. **Soft Proof**: View → Proof Colors to preview print output
4. **Adjust if needed**: Some RGB colors can't be reproduced in print

<Callout type="info">
For consumer photo printing (Walmart, Costco, online services), RGB is usually fine—they handle conversion automatically.
</Callout>

### Step 5: Export Settings

| Print Service Type | Format | Color | Resolution |
|-------------------|--------|-------|------------|
| Professional print shop | TIFF | CMYK | Native |
| Consumer photo printing | JPEG (95%) | sRGB | Native |
| Canvas/metal prints | JPEG (90%) | sRGB | Native |
| Fine art printing | TIFF | Adobe RGB | Native |

## Optimizing Different Midjourney Styles

![Various digital art styles displayed on screens](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563089145-599997674d42?w=800&q=80)
*Different artistic styles benefit from tailored upscaling approaches.*

Different art styles require different upscaling approaches:

### Photorealistic Images

Midjourney's photorealistic outputs respond excellently to AI upscaling:

- **Recommended scale**: 4x
- **Focus areas**: Skin texture, hair detail, fabric
- **Watch for**: Over-sharpening on smooth gradients

### Illustrated/Stylized Art

Cartoon, anime, or illustrated styles:

- **Recommended scale**: 2-4x
- **Focus areas**: Clean line preservation, flat color areas
- **Watch for**: Unwanted texture addition to flat areas

### Abstract and Painterly

Artistic, brushstroke-heavy styles:

- **Recommended scale**: 2x (start conservative)
- **Focus areas**: Brush texture, color transitions
- **Watch for**: AI "correcting" intentional imperfections

<Callout type="tip">
myimageupscaler.com handles both photorealistic and illustrated content well, but for anime-specific upscaling, you may want to use a 2x scale to preserve the clean aesthetic.
</Callout>

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Problem: Upscaled Image Looks Over-Sharpened

**Cause**: Some AI upscalers apply aggressive sharpening.

**Solution**:
- Use a more subtle upscaler like myimageupscaler.com
- Apply slight Gaussian blur (0.5px) in post-processing if needed
- Start with 2x instead of 4x scaling

### Problem: Colors Shifted After Upscaling

**Cause**: Color profile mismatch or compression artifacts.

**Solution**:
- Download original as PNG, not JPEG
- Ensure you're using the same color profile throughout
- Process from the highest quality source

### Problem: Visible Artifacts or Halos

**Cause**: JPEG compression in source, or upscaling beyond limits.

**Solution**:
- Always start from PNG source when possible
- Limit to 4x scaling maximum
- Use Midjourney's "Subtle" upscale before external processing

### Problem: Text or Fine Details Blurry

**Cause**: AI optimized for photos, not text.

**Solution**:
- Use myimageupscaler.com which preserves text
- For critical text, consider adding it in Photoshop after upscaling
- Avoid upscaling images with small text beyond 2x

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I upscale Midjourney images indefinitely?

No. Each upscaling pass adds some artifacts. Generally, limit yourself to:
- One Midjourney native upscale
- One external AI upscale (2-4x)

Going beyond this typically degrades quality.

### Is it legal to sell prints of upscaled Midjourney images?

As of 2024, Midjourney's Terms of Service allow commercial use for paid subscribers. However, copyright considerations are evolving—consult legal advice for commercial applications.

### What's the maximum usable print size from Midjourney?

With optimal workflow (native upscale + 4x AI upscale):
- **Starting from V6 at 2048×2048**: Up to 27×27 inches at 300 DPI
- **Starting from 1024×1024**: Up to 13×13 inches at 300 DPI

### Should I upscale before or after editing?

**Before editing**. Upscale first, then apply any color corrections, compositing, or retouching. This ensures your edits happen at full resolution.

### Does upscaling use Midjourney credits?

External AI upscaling (myimageupscaler.com) does not use Midjourney credits. Only Midjourney's native upscale functions consume GPU time.

### Can I upscale someone else's Midjourney images?

Technically yes (the upscaler doesn't know the source), but respect copyright and the original creator's rights. Only upscale images you have permission to use.

### What file format should I save upscaled images in?

- **For further editing**: PNG or TIFF (lossless)
- **For web use**: WebP or JPEG at 85%+ quality
- **For printing**: TIFF or high-quality JPEG (95%+)

## Pro Tips for Best Results

### 1. Generate at Higher Quality First

```
/imagine [prompt] --quality 2 --v 6
```

The `--quality 2` parameter gives Midjourney more processing time, resulting in more detail to preserve during upscaling.

### 2. Use Raw Style for Upscaling

```
/imagine [prompt] --style raw --v 6
```

"Raw" style applies less automatic enhancement, leaving more headroom for AI upscaling.

### 3. Avoid Heavy Post-Processing Before Upscaling

If you're going to upscale, do it before:
- Sharpening
- Heavy contrast adjustments
- Aggressive noise reduction

### 4. Keep Original Files

Always save your original Midjourney downloads. As AI upscaling technology improves, you can re-process them for even better results.

### 5. Test Before Committing

For important prints, order a small test print first. Screen displays and physical prints can look quite different.

## Recommended Workflow Summary

For best results every time:

1. **Generate** with `--quality 2` and appropriate aspect ratio
2. **Native upscale** using Upscale (Subtle)
3. **Download** the PNG from Discord (right-click → Open Original)
4. **AI upscale** with [myimageupscaler.com](/pricing) at 2-4x
5. **Color adjust** if printing (convert to CMYK)
6. **Export** in appropriate format for your use case
7. **Test print** before ordering large quantities
