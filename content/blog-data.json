      "content": "\nYou've sent an image to the printer only to receive a blurry, pixelated mess. Or worse—the print shop rejected your file entirely. Understanding image resolution for printing isn't intuitive, but it's essential for anyone who needs physical prints.\n\nThis guide explains DPI, resolution requirements, and how to ensure your images print beautifully at any size.\n\n## Understanding DPI vs PPI\n\nFirst, let's clarify the terminology that confuses everyone:\n\n**PPI (Pixels Per Inch)** - Describes digital images. How many pixels fit in one inch on screen.\n\n**DPI (Dots Per Inch)** - Describes printed output. How many ink dots the printer places per inch.\n\nIn practice, most people use \"DPI\" for both. When preparing files for print, you're really setting the PPI, but print shops call it DPI. We'll use DPI throughout this guide since that's what you'll encounter in the real world.\n\n## The Golden Rule: 300 DPI\n\nFor most printing purposes, **300 DPI** is the standard:\n\n| Print Type | Recommended DPI | Minimum DPI |\n|------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Photo prints | 300 | 200 |\n| Magazines | 300 | 300 |\n| Brochures | 300 | 250 |\n| Business cards | 300 | 300 |\n| Posters (close viewing) | 300 | 200 |\n| Billboards | 30-100 | 20 |\n| Banners (far viewing) | 100-150 | 75 |\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\nThe further away viewers will be, the lower DPI you can use. A billboard viewed from 50 feet away looks fine at 30 DPI. A photo held in your hands needs 300 DPI.\n</Callout>\n\n## Calculating Required Pixels\n\nHere's the formula you need:\n\n```\nRequired Pixels = Print Size (inches) × DPI\n\nExample: 8×10 inch print at 300 DPI\nWidth: 8 × 300 = 2400 pixels\nHeight: 10 × 300 = 3000 pixels\n```\n\n### Common Print Size Requirements\n\n| Print Size | At 300 DPI | At 200 DPI | At 150 DPI |\n|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| 4×6\" | 1200×1800 | 800×1200 | 600×900 |\n| 5×7\" | 1500×2100 | 1000×1400 | 750×1050 |\n| 8×10\" | 2400×3000 | 1600×2000 | 1200×1500 |\n| 11×14\" | 3300×4200 | 2200×2800 | 1650×2100 |\n| 16×20\" | 4800×6000 | 3200×4000 | 2400×3000 |\n| 24×36\" | 7200×10800 | 4800×7200 | 3600×5400 |\n\n### Quick Calculation Tool\n\nTo find your maximum print size from an existing image:\n\n```\nMax Print Size = Pixels ÷ DPI\n\nExample: 4000×3000 pixel image\nAt 300 DPI: 4000÷300 = 13.3\" × 3000÷300 = 10\"\nMaximum quality print: 13×10 inches\n```\n\n## When Your Image Is Too Small\n\nThis is where most people get stuck. You have a 1200×800 pixel image and need a 16×20 inch print.\n\n**The math:**\n- Required: 4800×6000 pixels (at 300 DPI)\n- Available: 1200×800 pixels\n- Shortfall: 4x upscale needed\n\n### Option 1: Accept Lower Quality\n\nPrint at lower DPI:\n- 1200÷16 = 75 DPI\n\nAt 75 DPI, prints will be noticeably soft. Only acceptable for:\n- Large posters viewed from distance\n- Draft/proof prints\n- Non-critical applications\n\n### Option 2: Print Smaller\n\nCalculate your true maximum size:\n- 1200÷300 = 4 inches (width)\n- 800÷300 = 2.7 inches (height)\n\nYour image can only print at 4×2.7 inches at full quality.\n\n### Option 3: AI Upscaling\n\nUse AI to intelligently add resolution:\n\n1. Upload to [myimageupscaler.com](/pricing)\n2. Apply 4x upscale (1200×800 → 4800×3200)\n3. Now print at 16×10.6 inches at 300 DPI\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nAI upscaling adds genuine detail, not just interpolated blur. Modern AI can reliably upscale 2-4x while maintaining print quality. Beyond 4x, results vary.\n</Callout>\n\n## Preparing Files for Print\n\n### Step 1: Check Your Current Resolution\n\nIn most image editors:\n- **Photoshop**: Image → Image Size\n- **GIMP**: Image → Scale Image\n- **Preview (Mac)**: Tools → Adjust Size\n\nNote both pixel dimensions and current DPI setting.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Requirements\n\nUse the formulas above to determine if your image is sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Upscale If Needed\n\nIf pixels are insufficient:\n\n1. **Upscale first** using AI enhancement\n2. **Then set DPI** in your image editor\n3. **Don't resize and set DPI simultaneously**—this causes quality loss\n\n### Step 4: Set Correct DPI\n\nIn Photoshop:\n1. Image → Image Size\n2. Uncheck \"Resample\"\n3. Set Resolution to 300 pixels/inch\n4. Dimensions will update to show print size\n\n<Callout type=\"warning\">\nIf \"Resample\" is checked, Photoshop will add/remove pixels when you change DPI. Keep it unchecked to just change the metadata without affecting pixel count.\n</Callout>\n\n### Step 5: Convert Color Mode\n\nPrint uses CMYK color, not RGB:\n- **RGB**: Screens (red, green, blue light)\n- **CMYK**: Print (cyan, magenta, yellow, black ink)\n\nFor professional printing:\n1. Convert to CMYK before sending\n2. Proof colors—some RGB colors can't be reproduced in print\n3. Ask your printer for their color profile\n\nFor consumer photo printing (Walmart, CVS, online services):\n- RGB is usually fine—they handle conversion\n- sRGB color space is safest\n\n### Step 6: Save in Correct Format\n\n| Format | Use For | Notes |\n|--------|---------|-------|\n| TIFF | Professional print | Lossless, large files |\n| PDF | Documents, posters | Preserves vectors and fonts |\n| JPEG | Photos | Quality 90+ for print |\n| PNG | Graphics with transparency | Not ideal for photos |\n\n## Special Printing Scenarios\n\n### Canvas Prints\n\nCanvas has visible texture that hides some detail:\n- 150-200 DPI is often sufficient\n- Smaller sizes still benefit from 300 DPI\n- Gallery wraps need extra margin for edges\n\n### Metal/Acrylic Prints\n\nThese show extreme detail:\n- 300 DPI minimum recommended\n- Higher is better—surface is very smooth\n- Imperfections are magnified\n\n### Large Format (Posters/Banners)\n\nViewing distance matters more than DPI:\n\n| Viewing Distance | Minimum DPI |\n|-----------------|-------------|\n| 1-2 feet | 200-300 |\n| 3-5 feet | 150-200 |\n| 6-10 feet | 100-150 |\n| 10+ feet | 50-100 |\n\n### Fine Art Prints\n\nGalleries and exhibitions demand highest quality:\n- 300 DPI minimum, 360 preferred\n- Giclée printers can use 360+ DPI\n- Paper quality matters as much as resolution\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\n### Example 1: Phone Photo to 8×10 Print\n\n**Situation**: iPhone photo (4032×3024 pixels) for framed 8×10 print\n\n**Calculation**:\n- Required: 2400×3000 at 300 DPI\n- Available: 4032×3024\n- Result: More than enough! Can print up to 13.4×10 inches\n\n**Action**: Crop to 8×10 ratio, no upscaling needed.\n\n### Example 2: Web Image to Poster\n\n**Situation**: Downloaded image (800×600) for 24×18 inch poster\n\n**Calculation**:\n- Required: 7200×5400 at 300 DPI (or 3600×2700 at 150 DPI)\n- Available: 800×600\n- Shortfall: Need 4.5-9x more pixels\n\n**Action**:\n1. Upscale 4x with AI → 3200×2400\n2. Print at 150 DPI = 21×16 inches (acceptable for poster)\n3. Or accept slightly soft results at 24×18\n\n### Example 3: Old Scanned Photo to Canvas\n\n**Situation**: Scanned photo (1800×1200 at 300 DPI) for 20×30 inch canvas\n\n**Calculation**:\n- Required: 4000×6000 at 200 DPI (canvas tolerance)\n- Available: 1800×1200\n- Shortfall: Need 2.2-3.3x more pixels\n\n**Action**:\n1. Upscale 4x with AI → 7200×4800\n2. Now exceeds requirements\n3. Canvas texture will hide any remaining softness\n\n## Troubleshooting Print Issues\n\n### \"Image Resolution Too Low\" Error\n\nThe print service is rejecting your file because pixels are insufficient.\n\n**Solution**: Upscale your image before uploading.\n\n### Colors Look Different in Print\n\nRGB to CMYK conversion changed colors.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Request a proof print first\n- Use printer's color profile\n- Avoid extremely saturated colors\n\n### Print Looks Blurry\n\nImage was stretched beyond its resolution.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Calculate true maximum print size\n- Upscale with AI before printing\n- Choose smaller print size\n\n### Banding in Gradients\n\nNot enough color information for smooth transitions.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Use 16-bit files if possible\n- Add slight noise to break up banding\n- Request higher quality printing\n\n## Workflow Summary\n\n1. **Determine print size** needed\n2. **Calculate pixels required** (size × DPI)\n3. **Check current image** pixels\n4. **Upscale if needed** using [AI enhancement](/pricing)\n5. **Set DPI metadata** (without resampling)\n6. **Convert color space** if required\n7. **Export** in appropriate format\n8. **Proof** before large print runs\n\n## Quick Reference Card\n\n```\nFORMULA:\nPixels Needed = Print Inches × DPI\n\nSTANDARD DPI:\nPhotos & Documents: 300\nPosters (close): 200-300\nPosters (far): 100-150\nBillboards: 30-100\n\nMAX PRINT SIZE:\nYour Pixels ÷ 300 = Max inches at quality\n\nUPSCALING LIMITS:\n2x = Excellent results\n4x = Good results\n8x+ = Variable quality\n```\n\n---\n\nNeed to upscale images for print?

      "content": "\nYou've crafted the perfect post, but your image looks pixelated on Instagram and cropped weirdly on LinkedIn. Every social media platform has different image requirements, and they change constantly. Getting it wrong means lost engagement and an unprofessional look.\n\nThis guide covers every image dimension you need for major social platforms in 2025—plus how to ensure your images meet these requirements even when your source photos are too small.\n\n## Quick Reference: All Platform Sizes\n\n### Instagram\n\n| Placement | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Square Post | 1080×1080 | 1:1 |\n| Portrait Post | 1080×1350 | 4:5 |\n| Landscape Post | 1080×566 | 1.91:1 |\n| Story/Reel | 1080×1920 | 9:16 |\n| Profile Photo | 320×320 | 1:1 |\n| Carousel | 1080×1080 | 1:1 |\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nInstagram's algorithm favors portrait (4:5) posts because they take up more screen space in the feed. Use 1080×1350 for maximum visibility.\n</Callout>\n\n### Facebook\n\n| Placement | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Feed Post | 1200×630 | 1.91:1 |\n| Story | 1080×1920 | 9:16 |\n| Cover Photo | 820×312 | 2.63:1 |\n| Profile Photo | 170×170 | 1:1 |\n| Event Cover | 1920×1005 | 1.91:1 |\n| Group Cover | 1640×856 | 1.91:1 |\n\n### Twitter/X\n\n| Placement | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| In-Stream Image | 1600×900 | 16:9 |\n| Card Image | 1200×628 | 1.91:1 |\n| Header | 1500×500 | 3:1 |\n| Profile Photo | 400×400 | 1:1 |\n\n### LinkedIn\n\n| Placement | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Feed Post | 1200×627 | 1.91:1 |\n| Article Cover | 1280×720 | 16:9 |\n| Company Cover | 1128×191 | 5.9:1 |\n| Profile Photo | 400×400 | 1:1 |\n| Background | 1584×396 | 4:1 |\n\n### Pinterest\n\n| Placement | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Standard Pin | 1000×1500 | 2:3 |\n| Square Pin | 1000×1000 | 1:1 |\n| Long Pin | 1000×2100 | 1:2.1 |\n| Profile Photo | 165×165 | 1:1 |\n\n### TikTok\n\n| Placement | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Video/Image | 1080×1920 | 9:16 |\n| Profile Photo | 200×200 | 1:1 |\n\n### YouTube\n\n| Placement | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| Thumbnail | 1280×720 | 16:9 |\n| Channel Banner | 2560×1440 | 16:9 |\n| Profile Photo | 800×800 | 1:1 |\n\n## The Problem: Your Images Are Too Small\n\nYou have a great product photo at 600×400 pixels. You need it for:\n- Instagram post (1080×1080)\n- Facebook ad (1200×630)\n- Pinterest pin (1000×1500)\n\nTraditional resizing would stretch and blur your image. Here's where AI upscaling becomes essential.\n\n## How to Resize Images for Any Platform\n\n### Step 1: Upscale to Maximum Needed Size\n\nCalculate the largest dimension you'll need across all platforms:\n\n```\nInstagram portrait: 1350px tall\nPinterest long pin: 2100px tall\nFacebook cover: 1200px wide\n\n→ Upscale source to at least 2100px on longest side\n```\n\n### Step 2: AI Upscale Your Source\n\nUsing [myimageupscaler.com](/pricing):\n\n1. Upload your original image\n2. Select 2x or 4x upscale (whichever gets you above your max needed size)\n3. Download the enhanced version\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\nAlways upscale once to your maximum needed size, then crop down for smaller formats. Never upscale the same image multiple times—quality degrades with each pass.\n</Callout>\n\n### Step 3: Create Platform-Specific Versions\n\nFrom your upscaled master, crop to each platform's requirements:\n\n**For Instagram (1080×1350):**\n- Crop to 4:5 aspect ratio\n- Export at 1080×1350\n\n**For Facebook (1200×630):**\n- Crop to 1.91:1 aspect ratio\n- Export at 1200×630\n\n**For Pinterest (1000×1500):**\n- Crop to 2:3 aspect ratio\n- Export at 1000×1500\n\n## Platform-Specific Tips\n\n### Instagram Best Practices\n\n- **Use portrait orientation** (4:5) for feed posts—more screen real estate\n- **Carousel posts** get higher engagement—all images should be consistent size\n- **Stories**: Full-screen 9:16, keep text away from top/bottom 250px (UI overlays)\n- **Minimum resolution**: 1080px wide (Instagram compresses smaller images aggressively)\n\n### Facebook Best Practices\n\n- **Link previews** auto-crop to 1.91:1—design for this ratio\n- **Cover photos** display differently on mobile vs desktop—keep key content centered\n- **Avoid text over 20%** of image area for ads (algorithm penalty)\n\n### LinkedIn Best Practices\n\n- **Professional aesthetic**—avoid overly casual or meme-style images\n- **Article covers** should be high-contrast and readable at small sizes\n- **Company page banners** get cropped on mobile—test both views\n\n### Pinterest Best Practices\n\n- **Vertical pins** (2:3 ratio) perform best—they dominate the feed\n- **Text overlays** are common and effective on Pinterest\n- **Rich, saturated colors** tend to get more saves\n- **Minimum 600px wide** to avoid quality loss\n\n### Twitter/X Best Practices\n\n- **16:9 ratio** displays without cropping in timeline\n- **Cards** (1.91:1) for link previews and ads\n- **GIFs and video** often outperform static images\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### 1. Uploading Too-Small Images\n\nEach platform has minimum requirements. Upload smaller images and they'll be:\n- Stretched (blurry)\n- Rejected (ads)\n- Compressed aggressively (grainy)\n\n**Solution**: Always upscale to meet or exceed minimum dimensions.\n\n### 2. Ignoring Aspect Ratios\n\nUploading a square image to a 16:9 placement means:\n- Auto-cropping (losing content)\n- Letterboxing (wasted space)\n- Unprofessional appearance\n\n**Solution**: Create platform-specific crops from your master image.\n\n### 3. Over-Compressing\n\nSaving as low-quality JPEG to reduce file size makes images look terrible on high-DPI screens.\n\n**Solution**: Export at quality 80-90%. Platforms will compress further—don't do it twice.\n\n### 4. Forgetting Mobile\n\nMost social media consumption happens on phones. Images that look good on desktop may:\n- Have unreadable text on mobile\n- Lose important details when scaled down\n- Crop unexpectedly on smaller screens\n\n**Solution**: Preview on mobile before posting. Design for the smallest screen.\n\n## Batch Processing for Multiple Platforms\n\nManaging images for multiple platforms is time-consuming. Here's an efficient workflow:\n\n### 1. Start with High-Resolution Source\n\n- Photograph at highest quality settings\n- Use RAW format when possible\n- If sourcing externally, request largest available\n\n### 2. Create a Master Upscaled Version\n\n- Upscale to largest needed dimension\n- Save in lossless format (PNG or TIFF)\n- This is your source for all derivatives\n\n### 3. Use Templates or Presets\n\nCreate saved crop presets for each platform:\n- Instagram Square: 1080×1080\n- Instagram Portrait: 1080×1350\n- Facebook Post: 1200×630\n- Pinterest: 1000×1500\n- etc.\n\n### 4. Export in Batches\n\nFor each piece of content:\n1. Open master image\n2. Apply each crop preset\n3. Export with platform-appropriate filename\n4. Upload to scheduling tool\n\n## File Format Recommendations\n\n| Platform | Recommended Format | Max File Size |\n|----------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Instagram | JPEG (posts), PNG (graphics) | 30MB |\n| Facebook | JPEG, PNG | 30MB |\n| Twitter | JPEG, PNG, GIF | 5MB (images) |\n| LinkedIn | JPEG, PNG | 8MB |\n| Pinterest | JPEG, PNG | 20MB |\n\n<Callout type=\"warning\">\nAvoid uploading PNG photos to Instagram—they get compressed more aggressively than JPEG. Use PNG only for graphics with text or transparency.\n</Callout>\n\n## Tools for Social Media Image Management\n\n### For Upscaling\n- [myimageupscaler.com](/pricing) - AI upscaling with text preservation\n\n### For Cropping/Resizing\n- Canva - Templates for every platform\n- Photoshop - Professional control\n- GIMP - Free alternative\n\n### For Batch Processing\n- Adobe Lightroom - Presets and batch export\n- XnConvert - Free batch converter\n- ImageMagick - Command-line automation\n\n## Future-Proofing Your Images\n\nSocial platforms regularly increase resolution requirements as screens improve.

      "content": "\nThat shoebox of old family photos in your closet holds priceless memories—but time hasn't been kind to them. Faded colors, scratches, low resolution from early digital cameras, or tiny prints that don't translate well to modern screens. You don't need to accept that these memories are locked in the past.\n\nAI photo restoration has made it possible for anyone to breathe new life into old images without expensive software or professional skills.\n\n## Why Old Photos Need Special Treatment\n\nOld photographs face unique challenges that standard editing can't solve:\n\n### Common Issues in Old Photos\n\n| Problem | Cause | Traditional Fix | AI Solution |\n|---------|-------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Low resolution | Small prints, early digital | Blur when enlarged | Intelligent detail addition |\n| Faded colors | UV exposure, age | Manual color correction | Automatic restoration |\n| Physical damage | Scratches, tears, water | Hours of cloning | Pattern-based repair |\n| Noise/grain | Old film, poor lighting | Smoothing (loses detail) | Detail-preserving denoising |\n\n### The Resolution Problem\n\nMost old printed photos, when scanned, produce images around 300-600 pixels wide. For modern use, you need:\n\n- **Social media**: 1080px minimum\n- **Digital frames**: 1920px for HD displays\n- **Reprinting**: 3000px+ for quality 8x10 prints\n\nTraditional upscaling can't bridge this gap without severe quality loss.\n\n## How AI Photo Restoration Works\n\nUnlike simple filters or manual editing, AI restoration uses machine learning to understand what your photo *should* look like.\n\n### The Technology Behind It\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition**: The AI identifies faces, textures, objects, and text\n2. **Training Data**: Models learn from millions of high-quality images\n3. **Intelligent Prediction**: Missing or damaged areas are reconstructed based on context\n4. **Detail Generation**: New pixels are created that look natural, not interpolated\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\nModern AI upscalers like myimageupscaler.com can add genuine detail to faces—enhancing eye clarity, skin texture, and hair definition that simply wasn't visible in the original.\n</Callout>\n\n## Step-by-Step: Restoring Your Family Photos\n\n### Step 1: Digitize Your Photos Properly\n\nThe quality of your restoration depends on your scan quality.\n\n**Scanning Recommendations:**\n\n- **Resolution**: 600 DPI minimum, 1200 DPI for small prints\n- **Format**: TIFF or PNG (not JPEG for master copies)\n- **Color depth**: 24-bit color or 16-bit grayscale\n- **Clean the scanner**: Dust shows up at high resolution\n\n**For phone scanning:**\n- Use good lighting (natural, indirect)\n- Keep the phone parallel to the photo\n- Use a scanning app for automatic cropping and correction\n\n### Step 2: Basic Cleanup (Optional)\n\nBefore AI enhancement, consider quick fixes:\n\n- **Crop**: Remove damaged borders\n- **Rotate**: Correct slight tilts\n- **Remove obvious spots**: Large dust marks or stains\n\nHowever, AI can often handle these automatically, so don't spend hours on manual cleanup.\n\n### Step 3: AI Enhancement\n\nUsing myimageupscaler.com for restoration:\n\n1. **Upload** your scanned photo\n2. **Select 2x or 4x upscale** depending on starting resolution\n3. **Process** (typically 30-60 seconds)\n4. **Download** your enhanced image\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nFor very old photos (pre-1950s), the 2x setting often produces more natural results than 4x. The AI has less reference material for antique photographic styles.\n</Callout>\n\n### Step 4: Final Adjustments\n\nAfter AI enhancement, you may want to:\n\n- **Adjust contrast**: Old photos often need slight contrast boost\n- **Color correction**: Fix remaining color cast issues\n- **Selective sharpening**: Enhance faces or key details\n\n## Before and After: What to Expect\n\nHere's what AI restoration can achieve:\n\n| Before | After |\n|--------|-------|\n| ![Before enhancement](/before-after/women-before.webp) | ![After enhancement](/before-after/women-after.webp) |\n\nNotice the difference in facial detail, hair definition, and overall clarity. The AI doesn't just enlarge—it enhances.\n\n## Best Practices for Different Photo Types\n\n### Portrait Photos\n\nPortraits benefit most from AI enhancement because faces are well-understood by modern AI:\n\n- **Focus on faces**: Ensure faces are in the sharpest part of your scan\n- **Don't over-process**: Subtle enhancement preserves period character\n- **Watch for artifacts**: Check eyes and teeth for unnatural sharpening\n\n### Group Photos\n\nLarge group shots are challenging due to small face sizes:\n\n- **Scan at maximum resolution**: You'll need every pixel\n- **Consider 4x upscaling**: Small faces need more enhancement\n- **Accept some limitations**: Very small faces may not fully resolve\n\n### Landscape and Location Shots\n\nVacation photos and scenery respond well to AI:\n\n- **Textures improve dramatically**: Foliage, buildings, water\n- **Architecture sharpens**: Windows, signs, details become clearer\n- **Watch the sky**: AI may add unwanted texture to smooth gradients\n\n### Photos with Text\n\nOld photos often include signs, documents, or captions:\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nmyimageupscaler.com is specifically optimized for text preservation. Handwritten captions on photo backs, street signs in the background, and document text all remain sharp and readable.\n</Callout>\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Over-Processing\n\n**Mistake**: Running the same photo through AI enhancement multiple times.\n\n**Why it's bad**: Each pass adds artificial detail. After 2-3 passes, faces look uncanny and textures become repetitive.\n\n**Solution**: One high-quality pass is better than multiple attempts.\n\n### Wrong Source Quality\n\n**Mistake**: Using a low-quality scan or phone photo of a photo.\n\n**Why it's bad**: AI can't recover detail that was never captured.\n\n**Solution**: Re-scan at higher resolution, or accept limitations.\n\n### Ignoring Original Character\n\n**Mistake**: Removing all grain and imperfections from vintage photos.\n\n**Why it's bad**: Some character comes from the era's photographic style.\n\n**Solution**: Aim for \"enhanced\" not \"modern looking.\"\n\n### JPEG Compression\n\n**Mistake**: Saving your scans as compressed JPEGs before enhancement.\n\n**Why it's bad**: JPEG artifacts get amplified during AI processing.\n\n**Solution**: Keep master copies in PNG or TIFF format.\n\n## Preserving Your Restored Photos\n\nAfter restoration, protect your work:\n\n### Digital Preservation\n\n- **Master copies**: Keep highest quality versions (PNG/TIFF)\n- **Web versions**: Create smaller JPEGs for sharing\n- **Cloud backup**: Store in multiple locations\n- **Metadata**: Add dates, names, and locations to file info\n\n### Physical Reprints\n\nYour restored photos can now be printed at sizes impossible with the originals:\n\n| Original Size | Restored Max Print |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| 2x3 inch | 8x12 inch |\n| 4x6 inch | 16x24 inch |\n| Wallet size | 5x7 inch |\n\nUse archival paper and inks for reprints you want to last.\n\n## What AI Can and Cannot Do\n\n### AI Excels At:\n\n- Increasing resolution intelligently\n- Enhancing facial features and details\n- Improving overall sharpness and clarity\n- Reducing noise while preserving detail\n- Reconstructing missing textures\n\n### AI Struggles With:\n\n- Severely damaged areas (large tears, missing sections)\n- Completely overexposed or underexposed regions\n- Faces that are extremely small or blurred\n- Reconstructing specific, unknown details\n- Matching exact historical photographic styles\n\n<Callout type=\"warning\">\nAI enhancement is not colorization. Black-and-white photos will remain black-and-white unless you use a specialized colorization tool (which is a different technology).\n</Callout>\n\n## Getting Started with Photo Restoration\n\nReady to restore your family memories? Here's your action plan:\n\n1. **Gather your photos**: Collect the ones most important to you\n2. **Prioritize**: Start with your most meaningful images\n3. **Scan properly**: Use the settings recommended above\n4. **Enhance**: Upload to [myimageupscaler.com](/pricing) for AI enhancement\n5. **Share**: Print, frame, or share digitally with family\n\nThe memories in those old photos deserve to be seen clearly.

      "content": "\nEver tried to enlarge a small image only to end up with a blurry, pixelated mess? You're not alone. Traditional image resizing simply stretches existing pixels, which inevitably degrades quality. But with modern AI technology, there's a better way.\n\n## Understanding Why Images Lose Quality When Enlarged\n\nWhen you scale up an image using traditional methods, your software has to \"guess\" what new pixels should look like. This process, called **interpolation**, has several approaches:\n\n- **Nearest Neighbor**: Simply duplicates pixels, creating a blocky look\n- **Bilinear**: Averages surrounding pixels, resulting in soft, blurry images\n- **Bicubic**: Uses more surrounding pixels for smoother results, but still loses detail\n\nNone of these methods can add new detail—they can only work with existing information.\n\n## How AI Upscaling Changes Everything\n\nAI upscalers work fundamentally differently. Instead of just interpolating pixels, they use **deep learning models** trained on millions of images to:\n\n1. **Recognize patterns** in your image (textures, edges, faces, text)\n2. **Predict missing detail** based on learned patterns\n3. **Generate new pixels** that look natural and sharp\n\nThis is why AI can produce results that look genuinely sharper, not just larger.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Quality Upscaling\n\n### 1. Start With the Best Source Possible\n\nEven AI has limits. Before upscaling:\n\n- Use the highest resolution version of your image available\n- Choose lossless formats (PNG, TIFF) over compressed ones (JPEG) when possible\n- Avoid images that have been upscaled multiple times\n\n### 2. Choose the Right Upscaling Factor\n\nMore isn't always better. Here's a practical guide:\n\n| Starting Resolution | Recommended Max Scale | Use Case |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| 1920x1080 | 4x | Print, large displays |\n| 1280x720 | 2-4x | Web, presentations |\n| 640x480 | 2x | Social media |\n| Below 500px | 2x only | Limited improvement |\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nFor best results, upscale in steps. Going from 500px to 2000px directly (4x) may produce worse results than doing 500px → 1000px → 2000px (2x twice).\n</Callout>\n\n### 3. Select the Right AI Model\n\nDifferent AI models excel at different content types:\n\n- **General Purpose**: Good all-around performance for most images\n- **Photo/Portrait**: Optimized for faces and skin tones\n- **Anime/Illustration**: Preserves clean lines and flat colors\n- **Text/Document**: Maintains sharp text and logos\n\nmyimageupscaler.com automatically detects your content type, but you can override this for specialized needs.\n\n### 4. Post-Process for Perfection\n\nAfter AI upscaling, consider these finishing touches:\n\n- **Sharpen lightly**: A subtle unsharp mask (0.3-0.5 amount) can enhance edges\n- **Adjust contrast**: AI upscaling sometimes reduces contrast slightly\n- **Check for artifacts**: Look closely at faces, text, and repeating patterns\n\n## Common Upscaling Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Over-Upscaling\n\nPushing beyond 4x magnification rarely produces good results. If you need a larger image, consider:\n\n- Finding a higher-resolution original\n- Using the image at a smaller display size\n- Accepting some quality loss for the size you need\n\n### Wrong Input Format\n\nJPEG compression creates artifacts that AI will amplify. If possible:\n\n1. Source images in PNG or TIFF format\n2. If only JPEG is available, don't re-compress before upscaling\n3. Save your upscaled result in a lossless format\n\n### Ignoring Content-Specific Settings\n\nA general-purpose upscaler will struggle with:\n\n- **Text**: May become readable but look \"AI-generated\"\n- **Fine patterns**: Can create moiré or repeating artifacts\n- **Faces**: May alter features if not using face-aware models\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\n### E-commerce Product Photos\n\nOnline sellers often receive manufacturer images that are too small for their stores. AI upscaling lets you:\n\n- Meet marketplace minimum resolution requirements\n- Enable zoom functionality for customers\n- Create consistent image sizes across your catalog\n\n### Print Production\n\nThat web image (72 DPI) needs to be printed? Here's how to calculate what you need:\n\n```\nPrint size (inches) × Print DPI = Pixels needed\nExample: 8\" × 300 DPI = 2400 pixels\n```\n\nIf your source is 800px wide, you need 3x upscaling for an 8-inch print at 300 DPI.\n\n### Social Media Optimization\n\nEach platform has ideal dimensions:\n\n- **Instagram Post**: 1080×1080 (1:1)\n- **Instagram Story**: 1080×1920 (9:16)\n- **Facebook**: 1200×630\n- **Twitter**: 1600×900\n\nAI upscaling ensures your images look crisp across all platforms.\n\n## Comparing AI Upscaling Results\n\nHere's what to look for when evaluating upscaled images:\n\n### Signs of Quality Upscaling\n- Edges appear sharp, not fuzzy\n- Textures look natural, not plastic\n- Text remains readable and crisp\n- No obvious halos around objects\n\n### Signs of Poor Upscaling\n- Blurry or soft edges\n- Waxy or plastic-looking skin\n- Visible repeating patterns (artifacts)\n- Text that looks \"painted\" rather than typed\n\n## Why Choose myimageupscaler.com for Image Upscaling\n\nmyimageupscaler.com is specifically designed to handle the challenges most upscalers struggle with:\n\n**Text and Logo Preservation**: Our AI model is trained to recognize and preserve text clarity, making it ideal for product images, documents, and branded content.\n\n**E-commerce Optimized**: We understand the specific needs of online sellers—maintaining product detail, accurate colors, and professional appearance.\n\n**No Watermarks**: Your upscaled images are yours, without any branding or watermarks.\n\n**Fast Processing**: Get results in 30-60 seconds, not minutes.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nReady to upscale your first image?

      "content": "\nIn e-commerce, your product images are everything. They're often the only way customers can evaluate your products before purchasing. Studies show that **75% of online shoppers** rely on product photos when making buying decisions, and listings with high-quality images see up to **94% more views**.\n\nBut what if your manufacturer images are low quality? What if you're reselling and can't do professional photography? This is where AI image enhancement becomes a game-changer.\n\n## Why Image Quality Directly Impacts Sales\n\n### The Psychology of Visual Trust\n\nWhen customers can't physically examine products, they rely on images to answer critical questions:\n\n- What does the texture look like?\n- How does it compare in size to other objects?\n- Are there any defects or issues?\n- Does it match the description?\n\nLow-quality images create doubt. High-quality images build confidence.\n\n### The Numbers Don't Lie\n\nResearch from major e-commerce platforms reveals:\n\n| Image Quality | Impact |\n|--------------|--------|\n| High-quality main image | +40% click-through rate |\n| Zoom functionality | +27% conversion rate |\n| Multiple angles | +58% engagement |\n| Consistent image style | +23% brand trust |\n\n## Common Image Problems E-commerce Sellers Face\n\n### 1. Manufacturer-Supplied Images\n\nMost manufacturers provide the bare minimum:\n- Low resolution (often under 1000px)\n- Inconsistent backgrounds\n- Poor lighting\n- No lifestyle context\n\n### 2. Marketplace Requirements\n\nEach platform has different standards:\n\n**Amazon**\n- Minimum 1000px on longest side (zoom requirement: 1600px+)\n- Pure white background (RGB 255,255,255)\n- Product fills 85% of frame\n\n**Shopify**\n- Recommended 2048×2048 for square images\n- Consistent aspect ratios across catalog\n- High-resolution for zoom\n\n**eBay**\n- Minimum 500px (recommended 1600px)\n- No watermarks or borders\n- Clear, well-lit photos\n\n### 3. Multi-Channel Selling\n\nSelling on multiple platforms means:\n- Different size requirements for each\n- Cropping and resizing constantly\n- Maintaining quality across all versions\n\n## How AI Enhancement Solves These Problems\n\n### Intelligent Upscaling\n\nUnlike traditional resizing, AI upscaling:\n\n- Adds genuine detail based on learned patterns\n- Preserves text and logos (critical for branded products)\n- Maintains edge sharpness\n- Doesn't introduce blur or artifacts\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\nmyimageupscaler.com's AI is specifically trained to preserve text and logos—a common weakness in other upscalers that often blur or distort product branding.\n</Callout>\n\n### Batch Processing\n\nFor sellers with large catalogs:\n\n- Process hundreds of images at once\n- Maintain consistent quality across all products\n- Save hours of manual editing time\n- Apply the same enhancement settings uniformly\n\n### Consistent Output\n\nAI ensures every image meets the same standard:\n- Uniform sharpness levels\n- Consistent color treatment\n- Predictable output quality\n- Professional appearance throughout catalog\n\n## Step-by-Step: Optimizing Product Images with AI\n\n### Step 1: Audit Your Current Images\n\nBefore enhancing, identify what needs work:\n\n**Resolution Check**\n```\nImage width × Image height = Total pixels\nMinimum for e-commerce: 1,000,000 pixels (1 megapixel)\nIdeal for zoom: 4,000,000+ pixels (4 megapixels)\n```\n\n**Quality Assessment**\n- Are edges sharp or blurry?\n- Is text readable when zoomed?\n- Are colors accurate?\n- Any visible compression artifacts?\n\n### Step 2: Choose the Right Enhancement Level\n\n| Source Quality | Recommended Upscale | Expected Result |\n|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| 500-800px | 2x | Good |\n| 800-1200px | 2x | Excellent |\n| 1200-1600px | 2x | Professional |\n| Below 500px | 2x max | Acceptable |\n\n<Callout type=\"warning\">\nAvoid upscaling more than 4x total. If your source is 400px and you need 3200px, quality will suffer. Consider sourcing better originals.\n</Callout>\n\n### Step 3: Process Your Images\n\nUsing myimageupscaler.com:\n\n1. **Upload**: Drag and drop your product images\n2. **Select Scale**: Choose 2x for most cases, 4x for small sources\n3. **Process**: AI enhancement takes 30-60 seconds\n4. **Download**: Get your enhanced images in original format\n\n### Step 4: Optimize for Each Platform\n\nAfter AI enhancement, prepare platform-specific versions:\n\n**For Amazon**\n- Crop to pure white background\n- Ensure product fills 85% of frame\n- Export at 2000×2000 minimum\n\n**For Shopify**\n- Maintain consistent aspect ratio (1:1 recommended)\n- Export at 2048×2048\n- Consider transparent backgrounds for versatility\n\n**For Social Media**\n- Create square versions for Instagram\n- Wider formats for Facebook/Pinterest\n- Add lifestyle context where appropriate\n\n## Advanced Techniques for E-commerce Images\n\n### Hero Image Optimization\n\nYour main product image drives clicks. Maximize its impact:\n\n1. **Start with the best angle**: Show the product's most appealing view\n2. **Enhance to maximum quality**: Use AI upscaling generously\n3. **Ensure text legibility**: Product names, sizes, and features must be readable\n4. **Test at thumbnail size**: Does it still look good at 100×100?\n\n### Supporting Image Strategy\n\nBeyond the main image:\n\n- **Detail shots**: Texture, materials, craftsmanship\n- **Scale reference**: Show size relative to common objects\n- **In-use shots**: Help customers visualize ownership\n- **Feature callouts**: Highlight key selling points\n\n### Text and Label Considerations\n\nProduct packaging often includes important information:\n\n- Ingredient lists\n- Size specifications\n- Brand names and logos\n- Certification marks\n\nStandard upscalers often blur this text. myimageupscaler.com's text-preservation AI keeps labels readable—crucial for products where text is a selling point.\n\n## ROI of Image Enhancement\n\n### Time Savings\n\nManual image editing per product:\n- Photoshop enhancement: 15-30 minutes\n- Background removal: 10-20 minutes\n- Resizing/formatting: 5-10 minutes\n\n**Total: 30-60 minutes per product**\n\nWith AI batch processing:\n- Upload batch: 2 minutes\n- Processing: 1-2 minutes per image (parallel)\n- Download: 2 minutes\n\n**Total: 5-10 minutes for entire batch**\n\n### Conversion Impact\n\nImproved images typically deliver:\n- 20-40% increase in click-through rates\n- 10-25% improvement in conversion\n- Lower return rates (customers know what they're getting)\n- Higher customer satisfaction scores\n\n### Cost Comparison\n\n| Method | Cost per Image | Time per Image |\n|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| Professional photographer | $10-50 | N/A |\n| Freelance editor | $2-10 | 30+ min |\n| AI enhancement (myimageupscaler.com) | $0.09-0.29 | 1 min |\n\n## Best Practices for E-commerce Image Management\n\n### Maintain Original Files\n\nAlways keep your original, unprocessed images:\n- AI and techniques improve over time\n- Different platforms may need different processing\n- Originals are your fallback\n\n### Consistent Naming Convention\n\nOrganize enhanced images logically:\n```\n[SKU]_[angle]_[size].jpg\nExample: PROD001_front_2048.jpg\n```\n\n### Quality Control Checklist\n\nBefore publishing, verify:\n- [ ] Resolution meets platform minimum\n- [ ] Text and labels are readable\n- [ ] Colors appear accurate\n- [ ] No visible artifacts or distortion\n- [ ] Consistent with other catalog images\n- [ ] File size optimized for web\n\n## Getting Started with myimageupscaler.com\n\nReady to transform your product images?

      "content": "\nYou've found the perfect product image, but it's too small. You upscale it, and suddenly the brand name looks like it was written in fog. The ingredient list? Forget about it. Sound familiar?\n\nText preservation is the Achilles heel of most image upscalers. But with the right approach, you can maintain readable text even when significantly enlarging your images.\n\n## Why Text Is So Hard to Upscale\n\nUnderstanding the problem helps solve it. Here's why standard upscalers struggle with text:\n\n### The AI Training Problem\n\nMost AI upscalers are trained on photographs—landscapes, portraits, animals, objects. They learn to:\n- Smooth skin tones\n- Enhance natural textures\n- Soften backgrounds\n- Add detail to organic shapes\n\nBut text is fundamentally different:\n- Sharp, defined edges\n- High contrast against backgrounds\n- Precise geometric shapes\n- No tolerance for interpretation\n\nWhen an AI trained on photos encounters text, it treats it like any other high-contrast area—and often smooths it out.\n\n### The Rendering Challenge\n\nConsider what happens when upscaling the letter \"A\":\n\n**Original (10px tall)**\n- Clear, defined strokes\n- Each pixel is intentionally placed\n- Edges align with pixel grid\n\n**Upscaled (40px tall)**\n- AI must \"guess\" 16 new pixels for every original pixel\n- No training data about this specific font\n- Edges become probabilistic, not precise\n\nThe result? Fuzzy, uncertain-looking text.\n\n## Technique 1: Use a Text-Aware Upscaler\n\nThe most effective solution is using an AI model specifically trained to recognize and preserve text.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\">\nmyimageupscaler.com's AI is trained on both photographs AND documents, including product labels, packaging, and branded content. This dual training allows it to recognize text and apply appropriate enhancement strategies.\n</Callout>\n\n### How Text-Aware AI Differs\n\nStandard upscaler approach:\n1. Analyze local pixel patterns\n2. Apply general enhancement model\n3. Generate new pixels based on photo training\n\nText-aware approach:\n1. Detect regions containing text\n2. Apply specialized text enhancement\n3. Maintain sharp edges and contrast\n4. Preserve character shapes precisely\n\n### Choosing the Right Tool\n\nLook for upscalers that specifically mention:\n- \"Text preservation\"\n- \"Document enhancement\"\n- \"OCR-aware processing\"\n- \"Logo/branding optimization\"\n\nAvoid tools marketed only for:\n- \"Photo enhancement\"\n- \"Portrait retouching\"\n- \"Anime/illustration upscaling\"\n\n## Technique 2: Optimize Your Source Image\n\nBetter input = better output. Before upscaling:\n\n### Check Image Compression\n\nJPEG compression creates artifacts around text that get amplified during upscaling.\n\n**Before upscaling, convert if possible:**\n- JPEG → PNG (won't improve quality, but prevents further degradation)\n- Request original files from suppliers in lossless formats\n- Use highest quality JPEG setting if re-saving\n\n### Verify Text Is Actually Text\n\nSometimes what looks like text is actually:\n- Text rendered into a photograph\n- Low-resolution screenshot of text\n- Already-upscaled and degraded text\n\nIf text is already compromised, even the best AI will struggle.\n\n### Consider the Background\n\nText sharpness depends heavily on background contrast:\n\n| Background Type | Upscaling Difficulty | Tips |\n|----------------|---------------------|------|\n| Solid white | Easy | Best case scenario |\n| Solid color | Easy | Maintain high contrast |\n| Gradient | Medium | May introduce artifacts |\n| Textured | Hard | Consider masking |\n| Photograph | Very Hard | May need manual touch-up |\n\n## Technique 3: The Two-Pass Method\n\nFor critical images where text must be perfect, consider this workflow:\n\n### Step 1: Isolate Text Regions\n\nUsing Photoshop, GIMP, or similar:\n1. Select areas containing text\n2. Copy to a new layer\n3. Keep a version with text regions masked out\n\n### Step 2: Upscale Separately\n\n- **Background layer**: Use any high-quality upscaler\n- **Text layer**: Use a text-aware upscaler (like myimageupscaler.com)\n\n### Step 3: Composite\n\n1. Place upscaled background\n2. Position upscaled text layer on top\n3. Blend edges if necessary\n4. Flatten and export\n\nThis method takes more time but produces professional results for high-stakes images.\n\n## Technique 4: Upscale Before Compression\n\nThe order of operations matters:\n\n**Wrong order:**\n1. Receive JPEG image\n2. Resize for web\n3. Re-save as JPEG\n4. Upscale (text is now double-compressed and degraded)\n\n**Right order:**\n1. Receive image\n2. Upscale with text-aware AI (while quality is best)\n3. Resize and format for specific platforms\n4. Compress once at final output\n\n## Technique 5: Post-Processing for Text\n\nAfter AI upscaling, you can enhance text further:\n\n### Selective Sharpening\n\nIn Photoshop or similar:\n1. Select text regions (use color range or quick selection)\n2. Apply Unsharp Mask:\n   - Amount: 80-120%\n   - Radius: 0.5-1.0 pixels\n   - Threshold: 0-5 levels\n3. Deselect and compare\n\n<Callout type=\"warning\">\nBe subtle with sharpening. Over-sharpening creates halos and artifacts that look worse than soft text.\n</Callout>\n\n### Contrast Adjustment\n\nText often benefits from local contrast boost:\n\n1. Select text regions\n2. Apply Curves or Levels adjustment:\n   - Slightly darken dark areas (black text)\n   - Slightly brighten light areas (white backgrounds)\n3. Adjust until text appears crisp without looking artificial\n\n### Noise Reduction\n\nIf upscaling introduced noise around text:\n1. Select text regions with slight feather\n2. Apply light noise reduction\n3. Avoid strong smoothing (will blur text)\n\n## Real-World Application: Product Labels\n\nLet's walk through a common scenario:\n\n### The Challenge\n\nYou have a product image with:\n- Brand logo (top)\n- Product name (middle)\n- Ingredient list (bottom, small text)\n- Nutrition facts (side panel)\n\nThe image is 800×600 and needs to be 2400×1800 for your store's zoom feature.\n\n### The Solution\n\n**Option A: Single-Pass (Recommended for most cases)**\n\n1. Upload to myimageupscaler.com\n2. Select 4x upscale (gets you to 3200×2400)\n3. Download and crop/resize to exact needed dimensions\n4. Verify all text is readable\n\n**Option B: Two-Pass (For critical images)**\n\n1. Duplicate the image\n2. Mask the background in version A\n3. Mask everything except text in version B\n4. Upscale both with appropriate settings\n5. Composite in Photoshop\n6. Final adjustments and export\n\n### Quality Check\n\nAfter upscaling, verify:\n\n- [ ] Brand logo is sharp and colors are accurate\n- [ ] Product name is clearly readable\n- [ ] Ingredient list is legible (test at actual display size)\n- [ ] Nutrition facts are readable\n- [ ] No halos or artifacts around text\n- [ ] Background doesn't show compression artifacts\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### 1. Over-Upscaling\n\nGoing beyond 4x for text-heavy images rarely works well:\n- 2x: Usually excellent results\n- 4x: Good results with quality AI\n- 8x+: Text will likely degrade regardless of tool\n\n### 2. Multiple Re-Processing\n\nEach time you process an image, quality degrades:\n- Upscale → Compress → Upscale again = Bad\n- Start fresh from original each time\n\n### 3. Ignoring Font Size\n\nVery small text (under 8px) may be unrecoverable:\n- Consider if text needs to be readable\n- Sometimes it's better to add text as a separate layer post-upscale\n\n### 4. Wrong File Format\n\nDon't save text-heavy images as heavily compressed JPEG:\n- Use PNG for images where text quality matters\n- If JPEG is required, use quality 90+ settings\n\n## When AI Upscaling Isn't Enough\n\nSometimes the honest answer is that upscaling can't achieve your goals:\n\n### Consider Alternatives When:\n\n- Source text is already unreadable\n- Required upscale exceeds 4x\n- Text is on complex, textured backgrounds\n- Absolute precision is required (legal documents)\n\n### Alternative Approaches:\n\n1. **Request better source files** from suppliers\n2. **Recreate text** by typing over in Photoshop\n3. **Accept limitations** and use smaller display size\n4. **Professional retouching** for high-value images\n\n## Tools That Excel at Text Preservation\n\nBased on our testing, here's how popular upscalers handle text:\n\n| Tool | Text Quality | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| myimageupscaler.com | Excellent | Specifically trained for text |\n| Let's Enhance | Good | Decent but not specialized |\n| Topaz Gigapixel | Good | Better with recent updates |\n| Upscale.media | Fair | Tends to soften text |\n| Bigjpg | Poor | Designed for anime, not text |\n| Waifu2x | Very Poor | Will destroy text |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nKeeping text sharp when upscaling product photos requires understanding why text is different from photographs and using appropriate tools and techniques.\n\nFor most e-commerce sellers, the simplest solution is using a text-aware AI upscaler like myimageupscaler.com. It handles the complexity automatically, preserving brand logos, product names, and specification text without manual intervention.\n\nFor critical applications where text absolutely must be perfect, the two-pass method (separating text and background) provides maximum control at the cost of additional time.\n\nRemember: the best results start with the best source. Whenever possible, obtain the highest quality original images before beginning any enhancement workflow.\n\n---\n\nReady to try text-preserving AI upscaling?
