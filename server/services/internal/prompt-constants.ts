  rules: `ANALYSIS RULES:
1. Detect content type: Is this a photo, portrait (faces), document/text, anime/illustration, vintage photo, or product shot?
2. Identify quality issues: blur, noise, compression artifacts, physical damage, low resolution
3. Match the best model:
   - Faces/portraits → use face restoration models (gfpgan, clarity-upscaler)
   - Text/documents → use text-preserving model (nano-banana)
   - Anime/illustrations → use realesrgan-anime (ONLY for animated/drawn content)
   - Clean image needing bigger size → use real-esrgan (cheapest, fast)
   - Noisy/compressed but resolution OK → use enhancement-only models (seedream, qwen-image-edit)
   - Premium quality needed → use higher-credit models
4. IMPORTANT: Don't over-process. If an image is clean and just needs upscaling, recommend the basic upscaler.
5. Balance quality vs cost: recommend cheaper models when they'll produce similar results.`,

  issueTypes: `ISSUE TYPES (use one type per issue, create multiple issues if needed):
- blur: Image lacks sharpness, soft focus
- noise: Visible grain, sensor noise, film grain
- compression: JPEG artifacts, blocking, banding
- damage: Scratches, tears, stains, physical damage
- low_resolution: Image is small/pixelated, needs upscaling
- faces: Contains faces that would benefit from restoration
- text: Contains text/logos that must be preserved`,

  guidelines: `enhancementPrompt GUIDELINES:
- Be specific about what to fix based on the actual image content
- Mention specific areas if relevant: "Remove artifacts in upper left, restore faded colors"
- Keep natural: "Enhance while preserving natural textures" not "make perfect"`,
