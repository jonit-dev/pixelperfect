- **Industry standard:** Let's Enhance, VanceAI use this model
- **Flexibility:** Credits roll over (2-6x by tier), reducing churn
- **Predictable revenue:** Monthly/annual recurring

## Pricing Optimization

### A/B Tests to Run

1. **Annual discount:** 17% vs 20% vs 25%
2. **Free tier limits:** 5 vs 10 vs 20 images
3. **Credit rollover:** 2x vs 3x multiplier
4. **Add-on bundling:** Separate vs bundled pricing

### Key Metrics to Track

- Plan distribution (which tiers sell)
- Upgrade/downgrade patterns
- Churn by plan
- Feature usage by plan
- Credit utilization rate

---

## Risk Mitigation

### API Price Increases

**Mitigation:**

- Multi-provider strategy (Stability AI, Hugging Face as backups)
- Self-hosting evaluation at 100k+ images/month
- Price increase clause in ToS

### High Churn

**Mitigation:**

- Credit rollover (reduces "use it or lose it" pressure)
- Annual plans (lock-in)
- Proactive customer success

### Low Conversion

**Mitigation:**

- A/B test free tier limits
- Improve onboarding flow
- Add high-value features to paid tiers
