## Unique Differentiators

### 1. Text & Logo Preservation (Blue Ocean)

**The problem nobody else solved:**

- E-commerce: Product labels become illegible
- Real estate: Property addresses blur
- Marketing: Brand logos lose sharpness

**Competitor Status:** ALL fail (Topaz, Let's Enhance, Magnific, VanceAI, Upscale.media)

**Our Advantage:** OCR-aware enhancement that protects text regions.

### 2. Speed as Feature

| Competitor          | Processing Time |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Topaz Labs          | 90+ minutes     |
| Magnific AI         | 30-60 seconds   |
| Let's Enhance       | 10-30 seconds   |
| **MyImageUpscaler** | **<10 seconds** |

Real-ESRGAN on A100: ~0.7 seconds per image.

### 3. Business Focus (Not Consumer/Artist)

| Competitor    | Target            | Gap We Fill               |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Topaz         | Pro photographers | Speed + web access        |
| Magnific      | AI artists        | Business users + pricing  |
| Remini        | Consumers         | Trust + no face invention |
| Let's Enhance | General           | E-commerce focus          |

**Our Position:** Practical business tools, not creative/artistic features.

### 4. Transparent & Ethical

| Issue              | Competitors             | Us                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Face invention     | Remini invents faces    | Never invent details |
