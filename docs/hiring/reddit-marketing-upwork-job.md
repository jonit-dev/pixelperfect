# Reddit Marketing Specialist for AI Image Upscaling SaaS

## About Us

We're building MyImageUpscaler, an AI-powered image upscaling tool that helps e-commerce sellers, content creators, and photographers enhance their images at a fraction of the cost of competitors like Topaz or Let's Enhance.

## What We're Looking For

We need someone who truly understands Reddit's culture and can grow our presence **organically and authentically** — no spam, no shortcuts. You'll be engaging in relevant communities, providing genuine value, and building our brand reputation over time.

## Responsibilities

- Identify and engage in subreddits relevant to our audience (e-commerce, Etsy sellers, photography, content creation, AI tools, real estate)
- Provide helpful, value-first responses where our tool naturally fits
- Build karma and credibility on aged/established accounts
- Create occasional high-quality posts (tutorials, before/after showcases, helpful guides)
- Track engagement and report weekly on activities
- Stay within Reddit's rules — no manipulation or brigading

## Requirements

- Proven Reddit marketing experience with case studies
- Deep understanding of Reddit culture and community guidelines
- Experience with SaaS or tech products (preferably B2C)
- Native or near-native English
- Patient, long-term mindset (this is not a quick-win channel)

## Budget & Hours

**$5/hour** — Estimated 10-20 hours/month

## Screening Questions

1. **What's your Reddit account age and karma?** (Accounts under 1 year or under 5,000 karma won't be considered)

2. **Name 5 specific subreddits where our target audience (e-commerce sellers, photographers, content creators) hangs out.** Explain why each is a good fit.

3. **What's the difference between a "soft mention" and a "hard promotion" on Reddit?** When would you use each?

4. **Describe a Reddit marketing campaign you've run.** What was the product? What subreddits? What results? (Provide proof if possible)

5. **A post you made starts getting called out as promotional. How do you handle it?**

6. **What metrics do you track to measure Reddit marketing success?**

7. **How long does it typically take to see meaningful results from organic Reddit marketing?**
